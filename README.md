# Apache Project Manager
A desktop application for managing projects on local Apache servers.

Every Web programmer or designer is often faced with the need to work on several projects and test them on a local server such as Apache (Installed together in tools such as WAMP, EasyPHP, etc.). Managing the multiple projects is often done by using subfolder, but this is not always handy, especially when document root references are involved. This simple tool simply accesses the Apache configuration, allowing you to change, in one click, the document root to any folder in your file system.
